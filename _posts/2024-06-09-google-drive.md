# Benefits Of Integrating Google Drive Into Your Apps

Integrating Google Drive into your apps offers numerous advantages, including free and scalable storage, enhanced security, seamless deployment, and global accessibility. This integration helps save bandwidth and ensures reliable file management, making it a valuable addition to any application.

## Free Storage with Google Drive

Creating a Google account is free and comes with 15GB of storage. For those needing more space, paid subscriptions offer storage starting from 1TB. This setup allows you to keep essential, infrequently changing files on your server while storing large or numerous static files, such as database backups, on Google Drive. This free storage is especially beneficial for affordable virtual private servers (VPS) costing under $30/month, which typically provide less than 500GB of storage.

## Secure File Management

Google Drive ensures your files are secure and only accessible by authorized users. When users upload files via the web app, these files are first sent to your web server, which then uploads them to Google Drive. Users cannot upload files directly to Google Drive, adding an extra layer of security. Those with access to the Google account can retrieve files directly from Drive if needed.

## Seamless Authorization

Integrating Google Drive with your app doesn't require your Google username or password for access. You only need to authorize the app once, and you can revoke this authorization at any time through your Google account settings under "Third-party apps & services."

## No-Installation Deployment

Deploying apps with Google Drive integration is straightforward. There's no need to install additional software on your server; simply include the Google Drive .NET DLLs during deployment. This is particularly advantageous in shared hosting environments where software installation is restricted.

## Reliable and Global Accessibility

With Googleâ€™s robust global infrastructure, your files can be reliably accessed from anywhere in the world. While not as specialized as a dedicated Content Delivery Network (CDN), Google Drive offers greater reliability compared to serving files directly from your server.

## Bandwidth Savings

Google Drive helps save bandwidth through efficient file distribution. Upload large files, such as videos and installers, once to Google Drive and share the download links with your users. This method minimizes bandwidth usage on your server, as Google handles the download traffic, reducing costs on your end.

If you are a project manager, now is an excellent time to discuss Google Drive integration with your development team. By leveraging this powerful tool, you can enhance your app's functionality, improve security, and reduce operational costs. Start the conversation today and begin reaping the numerous benefits that Google Drive has to offer.
